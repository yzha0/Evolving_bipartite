# Math Honor Thesis Dynamic Bipartite Networks: Detecting and visualizing structural change

## Abstract 
In exploring the evolution of networks, many researchers have focused on analyzing dynamics
of unipartite network. However, bipartite network structures are also essential in
understanding complex co-evolutionary processes. A significant proportion of foundational
work in bipartite networks has centered on ecological and biological networks as a way of
understanding mutualistic interactions within communities. In this study, we use a in silico
evolutionary model[2], inspired by a plant-pollinator communities to generate bipartite
network data for a co-evolving resource-user system. We then analyze this data to understand
network change over time. This thesis will primarily focus on mining of key network
structure indicators over time. Our goal is to understand how the structure of the bipartite
network, as well as its projected unipartite graphs, change over time. We notice that some
statistics may have similar, but different timings in which shifts appear. We then apply the
model-free anomaly detection methods by BenkÀùo et al (2022) based on calculations of the
Temporal Outlier Factor (TOF)[1] to these time-series data. This method automates the
process of identifying the unique points/periods where qualitative changes happen, so that
we can compare statistics in the same network.
